# Methods

## Statistical methods

For testing the mean differences between ICU and Non-ICU on the observed variables, first a non-parametric MANOVA was used for a test considering all the variable jointly(Woodrow _etal._, 2015). Hence, as a folow-up analysis, two sample tests were performed for each variable individualy using a test based on the Satterthwaite t-Approximation (Woodrow _etal._, 2017). This last test allowed to compute and evaluate relative effects of ICU and Non-ICU on each variable.

## Computational methods

Data analysis was performed using the software R version 4.0.5 (R Core Team, 2021). The following R packages were used: npmv (Woodrow _etal._, 2015), nparcomp (Woodrow _etal._, 2017), and ggplot2 (Wickham, 2016).
