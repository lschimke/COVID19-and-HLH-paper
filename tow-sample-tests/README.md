# Objective

To test for differences in the mean of several observed variables between ICU and Non-ICU COVID-19 patients.

# Methods

The statistical methods used for the data analysis are described in the files of the folder __methods__ along with references and statistical packages used.

# Statistical results

From the 504 observed variables only 212 had significantly mean differences between ICU and Non-ICU patients. FigS1 and TabS1 show the statistical results (_c.f._ directories of the folder __outputs__).

# Figures and tables

Figures and tables generated from the data analysis are in the directories of the folder __outputs__ along with their legends. Only low quality jpg figures are shown in this repository, however high quality pdf and png figures can be generated by following the steps below:

* Download the folder __two-sample-tests__ from this repository (in order to do this, copy the URL of this web page and visit [DownGit](https://downgit.github.io/#/home), paste the URL and download the folder!)
* Open it in RStudio and set it as your working directory
* Run the entire file _script.R_ located in the folder __codes__
* The pdf and png figures will be generated and saved in the directories of the folder __outputs__
