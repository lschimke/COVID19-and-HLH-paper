# Table caption

[TabS1] Results of two sample tests for the relative effects of ICU and Non-ICU. From left to right, columns show point estimates, lower and upper confidence limits for confidence intervals (CIs), observed test statistic, p-value. Confidence levels for CIs equals 95%.

[TabS2] Log2 fold change and p-values. For each observed variable, log2 fold change was calculated based on the raw data (before data transformation) using the formula log2(mean(ICU) / mean(Non-ICU)). P-values steem from two-sample-tests based on the Satterthwaite t-Approximation. Table columns: fc = fold change, p = p-value.
