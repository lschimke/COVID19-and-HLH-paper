# Figure caption

[FigS1] Point estimates and confidence intervals (CIs) for the relative effects of ICU and Non-ICU on each observed variable. Only showing observed variables with significantly different mean values between ICU and Non-ICU. The dashed horizontal line marks the point of no differences between ICU and Non-ICU. CIs below (above) the dashed horizontal indicate variables with greater tendency for higher values in ICU (Non-ICU). Confidence level of CIs equals 95%.

[FigS2] Log2 fold changes between ICU and Non-ICU groups plotted againts p-vlaues for the test of differences in the mean of the observed variable between these two groups of patients. For each observed variable, log2 fold change was calculated based on the raw data (before data transformation) using the formula log2(mean(ICU) / mean(Non-ICU)). P-values steem from two-sample-tests based on the Satterthwaite t-Approximation. The 10 down and upregulated variables with lowest p-values are shown with labels. The thresholds equal to 1 and -1 (shown as dashed verical lines) were used to determine which variables were down and upregulated. The horizontal dashed line marks the point where p-value = 0.05.
